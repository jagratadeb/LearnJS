# LearnJS

A comprehensive collection of JavaScript code examples, concepts, and mini-projects. This repository is organized into folders that cover the basics, DOM manipulation, practical projects, and interview preparation.

## Folder Overview

- [`001 Basic Concepts/`](./001%20Basic%20Concepts/): Contains foundational JavaScript topics, including variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, objects, strings, comments, strict mode, and advanced topics like promises and async/await. Each subfolder demonstrates a specific concept with simple, focused code examples.

- [`002 DOM JS/`](./002%20DOM%20JS/): Focuses on interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript. Includes examples for selecting elements, traversing parent/child/sibling relationships, manipulating HTML and text, handling events, styling, animations, and working with forms and browser features.

- [`003 Mini Projects/`](./003%20Mini%20Projects/): A set of small, practical JavaScript projects to reinforce learning. Example projects include a calculator, GitHub profile viewer, key logger, and countdown app. These projects combine multiple concepts and DOM manipulation to build interactive web applications.

- [`004 Interview Practice/`](./004%20Interview%20Practice/): A collection of JavaScript coding challenges and problems commonly asked in interviews. Each folder contains a focused problem (e.g., string reversal, leap year check, sum of elements) with a solution script to help you prepare for technical interviews.

Browse each folder for hands-on examples. Run `.js` files in your browser console or with Node.js as appropriate. For DOM examples and mini-projects, open the corresponding `index.html` in your browser.

Happy Learning!
