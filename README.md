## 📁 Repository Structure

- [`001 Basic Concepts/`](https://github.com/jagratadeb/LearnJS/tree/main/001%20Basic%20Concepts)
  Core JavaScript fundamentals: variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, objects, strings, comments, strict mode, and advanced topics (promises, async/await). Each subfolder demonstrates a focused concept with concise, practical code.

- [`002 DOM JS/`](https://github.com/jagratadeb/LearnJS/tree/main/002%20DOM%20JS)
  In-depth DOM manipulation: element selection, parent/child/sibling traversal, HTML/text manipulation, event handling, styling, animations, forms, and browser APIs. Each topic is organized for quick reference and experimentation.

- [`003 Mini Projects/`](https://github.com/jagratadeb/LearnJS/tree/main/003%20Mini%20Projects)
  Real-world JavaScript mini-projects: calculator, GitHub profile viewer, key logger, countdown app, color switcher, user list search, and more. Projects combine multiple concepts and DOM techniques to build interactive web applications.

- [`004 Interview Practice/`](https://github.com/jagratadeb/LearnJS/tree/main/004%20Interview%20Practice)
  Curated JavaScript coding challenges and interview problems. Each folder contains a focused problem (e.g., string reversal, leap year check, sum of elements) with a clear solution script for technical interview preparation.
