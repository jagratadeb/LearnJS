## 📁 Repository Structure

- **001 Basic Concepts/**  
  Core JavaScript fundamentals: variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, objects, strings, comments, strict mode, and advanced topics (promises, async/await). Each subfolder demonstrates a focused concept with concise, practical code.

- **002 DOM JS/**  
  In-depth DOM manipulation: element selection, parent/child/sibling traversal, HTML/text manipulation, event handling, styling, animations, forms, and browser APIs. Each topic is organized for quick reference and experimentation.

- **003 Mini Projects/**  
  Real-world JavaScript mini-projects: calculator, GitHub profile viewer, key logger, countdown app, color switcher, user list search, and more. Projects combine multiple concepts and DOM techniques to build interactive web applications.

- **004 Interview Practice/**  
  Curated JavaScript coding challenges and interview problems. Each folder contains a focused problem (e.g., string reversal, leap year check, sum of elements) with a clear solution script for technical interview preparation.
